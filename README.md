## Description

This repository contains a monorepo for a web application that **allows users to upload CSV files using drag-and-drop functionality.** The files are processed in the server and storaged in a mongodb database. Users can search through the data in the web application. Additionally, users can share their search results with others simply by **sharing the URL**.

## Features

- [x] File uploader with drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] API for uploading files to the server
- [x] Server-side processing of the uploaded file
- [x] File storage in a MongoDB database with a unique fileId
- [x] Search functionality from the frontend using the API
- [x] Shareable search results via URL
